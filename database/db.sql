-- 1. Opem XAMPP Manager                                                                          *
-- 2. Start All Servers in the "Manage Servers" tab                                               *
-- 3. Click to the "Welcome tab" and click "Go to Application"                                    *
-- 4. Once you have the XAMPP page open in your localhost,                                        *
--      click on the "phpMyAdmin" button on the page's header                                     *
-- 5. Once you have phpMyAdmin open, click on the "SQL" tab                                       *   
-- 6. Copy and paste the code below into the text box                                             *

-- 8. You should now have a database called "TLDR" with all the tables and data                   *
-- 9. You can now run the application and test queries.                                           *

-- ** If you mess something up and need to start again, just repeat the above steps.              *
-- ** The first couple lines of the database will drop the existing database and create a new one *
-- ** If you need to add more data, just add it to the bottom of the file and repeat steps 6-8    *
